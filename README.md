# A little bit about me...
I am a self-taught **Front End Developer** from Durban, South Africa. Although I am now on my journey as a web developer, I originally graduated with a **BA in Information Design** at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. I also have a passion for **long-exposure photography** and all things **Photoshop**- which I started to teach myself when I was only 10 years old! I believe that having design knowledge has really helped me to be a better Front End Developer, and I love creating my own content for my websites. 
Some of my other interests include:
 - **Sport:** Playing them, watching them.. everything. Go Sharks!
 - **Nature:** Yes I would love to go on that extremely long hike with you.
 - **Travel:** I make a killer trip itinerary, just saying...
 - **Arts & Culture:** You can never know enough!
 - **Gaming:** If only there were enough time to do it though...

## My journey

I have done my fair share of galivanting since leaving university- from working as a Photographer on a cruise ship in places like Alaska and the Baltics, backpacking through Patagonia, and to teaching English in Spanish speaking countries like Chile and Spain! I always found a way to incorporate my skills into these jobs, like creating digital content for the Photo manager, retouching away those wrinkles for a ship passenger, or creating and designing cool lesson presentations for all my teenage students. While others were starting their careers fresh out of university, I was gaining life experience, learning about different cultures and the people in them, learning a new language (Spanish) and living in countries with so much to learn from. And in the middle of all of that, I found my love for coding in a classroom full of 13 year old Spanish kids! Who would have guessed it would happen like that!? Since then, it has been a whole journey on it's own trying to learn how to code in my spare time while working abroad. But after 2+ years of hard work after hours, I was finally able to get to the point where I could call myself a Front End Developer. Now I am back home in South Africa, working on my coding full-time and excited to continue learning for a lifetime!

### Front End Web Development
When I decided to teach myself how to code, it was very overwhelming figuring out where to start. On recommendation I bought an online course by [ZTM Academy](https://zerotomastery.io/) called [The Complete Web Developer: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery). I deviated from the course **very** often to learn the same topics from different sources, such as [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [
Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) as well as articles, documentation, YouTube videos and forums. I also created my own personal projects along the way, some of which you can find here on GitHub:
- [Dodge Dat Door Game](https://github.com/moniquejb/dodge-dat-door) (fun personal project)
- [Pig Latin Translator](https://github.com/moniquejb/pig-latin-translator) (first website)

Although the online course I chose touched on both the Front End and Back End, I definitely felt more drawn to the Front End and have decided to focus on that field for the time being. I have noticed the big impact the Back End makes in a website though, so I really want to learn more Back End technologies so that I can be a well-rounded developer. After completing the course in March 2021, I was able to take on my first major project where I designed and created a website for Mexican psychologist, Cristina Conrique. Not only did I create her website, but I also designed her logo and photographed her for the 'About Me' section of her page. The website is in Spanish as she has a Spanish-only client base, and you can also find it here on GitHub:
- [Cristina Conrique Psychology](https://github.com/moniquejb/cristina-conrique-psychology) (commercial & most recent project) 

## What's next for me?
Although I have most of my experience in JavaScript, React, CSS/SCSS and HTML- I am eager to learn any language/library/framework necessary to move ahead and improve in this industry. A few things I touched on in the online course that I really want to spend more time on are Redux, Node.js and Express.js. I also want to dive even deeper into JavaScript and React. Why not learn a whole different framework as well while I'm at it? :nerd_face:

I am currently on the job hunt, feel free to contact me or share my work! :wink: I hope to find work in Cape Town, as I have always wanted to make that my home base. In the meantime I am also working on developing my own portfolio website and continuing to learn anything and everything I can.

 - **Currently learning:** Redux
 - **Currently working on:** Freelance Work
