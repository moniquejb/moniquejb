I am a **Frontend Software Developer** from Durban, South Africa - now living in Cape Town, South Africa. Although I am now on my journey as a Frontend Software Developer, I originally graduated with a distinction in **Information Design (BA)** at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. I also have a passion for **long-exposure photography** and all things **Photoshop**- which I started to teach myself when I was only 10 years old! I believe that having design knowledge has really helped me to be a better Frontend Developer, and I often create content for the sites I build. 

## My journey

During my studies, design thinking was always key to anything we produced. That approach really resonated with me and encouraged me to expand my mind by leaving my South African bubble for close to a decade- from working as a Photographer on a cruise ship in places like Alaska and the Baltics, to backpacking through Patagonia and teaching English in Spanish speaking countries like Chile and Spain! I always found a way to incorporate my skills into these jobs, like creating digital content for the Photo manager, retouching away those wrinkles for a ship passenger, or creating and designing cool lesson presentations for all my teenage students. Instead of diving straight into an industry after leaving university I chose to explore, work and live in different parts of the world in diverse work environments. For me, those experiences have been invaluable as each new experience proposed unique challenges that I overcame in unique ways. And in the middle of all of that, I found my love for coding in a classroom full of 13 year old Spanish kids! Who would have guessed it would happen like that!? Fast forward to 2024, I settled into an industry that is also constantly changing, growing and proposing new challenges. I have been employed full-time as a Frontend Software Developer since January 2022 and have learnt so much in the process. As a Frontend Software Developer I am still eager to explore possibilities and to come up with purposeful solutions to unique problems. I find myself most fulfilled when I am working on something that will really make a difference in somebody's life and where time has been taken to truly understand and solve the unique problem at hand.
